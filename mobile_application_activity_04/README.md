   # Day 4
<img src="process/day4.gif" height="500">  

    - iOS13 is nuts! Hot restart did not work
    - I would use AssetImage for the icon with inkWell
    - But at least would do the animation
    - http asset would not be implemented into this project,instead,json list data would be used mainly.
