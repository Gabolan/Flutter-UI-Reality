    - Objectives: Input Decoration + TabController * TabController Finished
    - Probably try IndexedStack to switch the page with index later on *Waiting to test
    - Declare a variable at first at first and change its value with setState and and 
    - use that variable later on and build Widgets according to that variable using if else or switch case.
    @ Solution: TabBarView
    -Waiting to finish: Input Decoration (Search Bar)

# Day 4
<img src="process/day4.gif" width="500" height="500"> 

     - Finished TabBarView and SearchBar(Input Decoration)
     - Dig into some listener,good article for textfield
     - Next Objectives:Card with Row (Or ListView) :
     - Use Dismissible to dimiss the object
     -(build a widget to avoid hard coding)
     - Class for storing different data(pic + name + description)
     * Problem: The info page is overflowed by keyboard when restarting the app without dismissing the keyboard.
     * Solution: (Challenge)to dismiss the keyboard when launch the app,but still usable in TextField
