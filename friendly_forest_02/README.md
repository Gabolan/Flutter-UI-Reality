    - Objectives: Input Decoration + TabController * TabController Finished
    - Probably try IndexedStack to switch the page with index later on *Waiting to test
    - Declare a variable at first at first and change its value with setState and and 
    - use that variable later on and build Widgets according to that variable using if else or switch case.
    @ Solution: TabBarView
    -Waiting to finish: Input Decoration (Search Bar)

# Day 4
<img src="process/day4.gif" width="500" height="500"> 

     - Finished TabBarView and SearchBar(Input Decoration)
     - Dig into some listener,good article for textfield
     - Next Objectives:Card with Row (Or ListView) :
     - Use Dismissible to dimiss the object
     -(build a widget to avoid hard coding)
     - Class for storing different data(pic + name + description)
     * Problem: The info page is overflowed by keyboard when restarting the app without dismissing the keyboard.
     * Solution: (Challenge)to dismiss the keyboard when launch the app,but still usable in TextField
     
     To support flutter web:
     -  flutter channel master
        flutter upgrade
        flutter config --enable-web
        cd <into project directory>
     *  flutter create .
        flutter run -d chrome
        To generate a release build:
     *  flutter build web

 # Day 5
<img src="process/day5.gif" width="500" height="500">  

    - Hard Coding mode,as can't push the index to change the colour when clicking the tab 
    - Would finish this project as soon as possible.And learn how to use setState and BloC to change state
    - Those remaining part are not hard,as data is the most difficult part in this project.
      

# Day 6
